# AIE241: Natural Language Processing Project
## Automated Robust Feedback Analysis System for Departments and Teachers

### Objective
To develop an application for streamlined feedback submission on academic departments and faculty.

### Key Features
- **Feedback Input**: A user-friendly interface for feedback submission.
- **Data Processing with NLTK**: Leverages the Natural Language Toolkit for advanced text analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies machine learning for sentiment detection in feedback.
- **Optimal Algorithm Selection**: Identifies the most efficient algorithm for sentiment extraction.
- **Feedback Classification**: Sorts feedback into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.

### Enhanced Machine Learning Approach
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier**: Text classification based on word frequency.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**: Optimizes hyperplane for class separation.
- **With Stemming**: Both classifiers include variants that apply stemming for potentially improved accuracy.

### Access Credentials
- **Admin**: `admin` | `admin`
- **Head of Department (HOD)**: `hod` | `hod123`
- **Teacher Access**: `teacher1` | `teachpass1`, `teacher2` | `teacher2`, ...

### Conclusion
This system enhances feedback analysis, providing key insights for academic enhancements.
